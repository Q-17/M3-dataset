# M3: A Multi-Image Multi-Modal Entity Alignment Dataset

>M3, an MMEA benchmark equipped with multiple images retrieved from respective search engines, which better mirrors real-life challenges. We utilize the widely used DBP15K dataset as the foundational dataset, which includes three cross-ingual datasets: Chinese-English (ZH-EN), Japanese-English (JA-EN), and French-English (FR-EN).

- After the paper is published, we will provide details of the dataset implementation, image embedding files, and detailed code information. For now, we are presenting some of the original image information from the dataset, which can be downloaded from [`Baidu Cloud Drive`](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BRX9qvS2bVdpS5--NEEF9A) with the pass code **`mmm3`**.
